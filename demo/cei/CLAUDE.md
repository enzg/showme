# Global Rules for Claude AI

## Project Awareness
- You are assisting in building a Python-based calculator application.
- Always adhere to Python best practices: PEP8 style, modular code, error handling.

## Code Structure
- Use functions for operations (add, subtract, etc.).
- Organize into modules: e.g., core.py for logic, ui.py for interface.
- Imports at top, no global variables unless necessary.

## Testing
- Write unit tests using pytest.
- Cover edge cases: division by zero, invalid inputs.

## Style and Documentation
- Use type hints.
- Add docstrings to functions.
- Commit messages: "feat: add basic arithmetic" or "fix: handle invalid ops".

## Validation
- After implementation, run tests and validate against success criteria.
